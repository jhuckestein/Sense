					<p>A 4-item measure of adjustment responses along a continuum between “Self” and “Situated-Other.”<br>
						If users understand the four factors and have only a brief moment, they can use this to submit experiences. <br></p>

							<b><p> Goal Commitment</b><p>
								When you think about your commitment to your assigned goals for this global experience, would you <br>
							say you were <b><i>mostly independent</i></b> (i.e., you acted independently to revise your goals according to the <br>
							situation and/or your personal needs at the time) OR <b><i>mostly allegiant</i></b> (i.e., regardless of situational<br>
							pressures or your needs at the time, you remained totally committed to your original assigned goals)?<br>

						<p>
							<b><p> Managing Stress</b><p>
								When you think about how you managed stress during this episode, would you say you were <b><i>mostly <br>
							problem-focused</i></b> (i.e., you analyzed the sources of stress and tried to change the situation to make it <br>
							less stressful) or <b><i>mostly emotion-focused</i></b> (i.e., you expressed/vented your feelings or tolerated the<br>
							stress without trying to change the situation).<br>

							<input id="slider1" type="range" min="0" max="6" step="1" />

						<p>
						<p>
							<b><p> Frame of Reference</b><p>
								When you think about how you framed and made sense of this episode, would you say you stretched <br>
							your frame of reference (<b><i>elastic</i></b>) because you considered to new ways of thinking, new roles, and new <br>
							possibilities, or did you not need to re-frame (<b><i>inelastic</i></b>) because your own cultural frame of reference,<br>
							self-concept, values, and beliefs provided the frame for you to interpret this experience.<br>

							<input id="slider1" type="range" min="0" max="6" step="1" />

						<p>
						<p>
							<b><p> Behavior</b><p>
								When you think about how you behaved during this episode, would you say you mostly tried to <b><i>adapt</i></b> <br>
							your behaviors to the situation (e.g., engaging in local activities, following local customs, or acting like <br>
							those around you) or you mostly behaved according to your own behavioral <b><i>scripts</i></b>, which reflect your <br>
							habits, your own customs and behavioral routines, and the way you normally conduct yourself?<br>
